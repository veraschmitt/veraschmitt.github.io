excerpt: 'FakeXplain â€“ Development of transparent and meaningful explanations for disinformation detection'
---

The FakeXplain project aims to examine different approaches to generating explanations of AI systems used for human-AI collaboration for the disinformation detection task. Explainability approaches such as attention-based explanations, attribution-based explanations, and computational argumentation will be examined throughout the project, but also recent approaches such as Chain-of-Thought Prompting and Mechanistic Interpretability will be examined concerning their meaningfulness and understandability to human users.
