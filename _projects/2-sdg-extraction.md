The ateSDG project is funded by the [Climate Change Center Berlin Brandenburg](https://www.climate-change.center/). The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) announced by the UN in 2015 are integrated into the Sustainability Reports of companies. To collect and aggregate information about the SDGs, Sustainability Reports from companies are analyzed and classified according to their contribution to one or multiple SDGs. The results are visualized in an SDG monitoring Dashboard for the Berlin Brandenburg region, to provide an overview, of which SDGs are worked on by different industry sectors.
