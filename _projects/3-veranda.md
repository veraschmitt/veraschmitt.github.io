The VERANDA project is dedicated to applied research into informational self-determination. This includes the analysis, conception, and implementation of information about risks and the sovereign handling of personal data. The project focuses on both the individual and societal level. Specifically, we are looking at the use case of self-determination over personal and highly sensitive medical data in the area of highly stigmatized groups.
