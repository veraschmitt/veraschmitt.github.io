Description
---
The project goal is to evaluate different methods for the monetary evaluation of privacy. Different user experiments have been conducted, to examine how the monetary valuation relates to various privacy constructs (e.g. privacy concern, awareness, privacy behavior, privacy literacy) and personality traits (e.g. Big 5, passive and active risk-taking, and state of hunger). I was the project leader, but did not acquire the funding for this project!

**Total funding amount:** EUR 233,220
