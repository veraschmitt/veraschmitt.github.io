- Head of [XplaiNLP Research Group](https://www.tu.berlin/qu/forschung/forschungsgruppen/xplainlp) at the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Quality and Usability Lab, Technische Universit√§t Berlin](https://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/menue/qu/parameter/en/)
- Guest Researcher at German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence [(DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/web/), Speech and Language Technology [(SLT)](https://www.dfki.de/web/forschung/forschungsbereiche/speech-and-language-technology/) group



Research Interest: 
======
- **Human-Computer Interaction:** Developing intelligent decision support systems (IDSS) for effective human-AI collaboration. With a focus on disinformation detection and medical data analysis, we emphasize transparency, usability, and explainable AI (xAI) to ensure these systems are practical and trustworthy, incorporating transparency metrics throughout the design.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Specializing in Information Retrieval, Entity Recognition, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for a range of tasks, including detecting and countering disinformation narratives with high accuracy and contextual understanding.
- **Legal and Ethical Considerations:** Assessing the impact of regulations like the AI Act, DSA, GDPR, and the Data Act on AI-based systems. We investigate the challenges these frameworks present for data aggregation and the ethical development of IDSS in contexts like disinformation and sensitive data handling.
