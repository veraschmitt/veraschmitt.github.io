- Research group lead of the [XplaiNLP Group](https://www.tu.berlin/qu/forschung/forschungsgruppen/xplainlp) at the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Quality and Usability Lab, Technische Universit√§t Berlin](https://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/menue/qu/parameter/en/)
- Guest Researcher at German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence [(DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/web/), Speech and Language Technology [(SLT)](https://www.dfki.de/web/forschung/forschungsbereiche/speech-and-language-technology/) group



Research Interest: 
======
- **Human-Computer Interaction:** development of intelligent decision support systems for human-AI collaborative tasks. Transparency and Usability are highly relevant to make AI-based IDSS useful, thus, we include xAI and transparency metrics in the IDSS design (use case: disinformation detection, medical data analysis)
- **Natural Language Processing:** Information Retrieval, Entity Recognition, Retrieval Augmented Generation, fine-tuning LLMs for various downstream tasks
- **Usable Security and Privacy:** GDPR compliance analysis, examining efficient ways of representing privacy-related information for several use cases, examining the economic value of privacy from the user's perspective
- **Legal and Ethical Considerations:** Analyse implications of the AI Act, DSA, GDPR, and Data Act on the data aggregation and development of AI-based IDSS for different use cases
