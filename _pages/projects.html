  <p><strong>BMBF Project: news-polygraph</strong><br>
  <strong>Grant Duration:</strong> 2023-05 to 2026-04, <strong>Grant Number:</strong> 01IS24066, <strong>Aquired funding amount:</strong> EUR EUR 1.492.547</strong> <br>
  The news-polygraph project is the biggest research project funded by the BMBF in Germany on mis-and disinformation detection with an overall funding volume of RUR 13.216.784. It brings together partners from industry, media, and research to work on effective solutions to integrate AI as intelligent decision support in the information verification workflow. Hereby, the XplaiNLP team from TU Berlin will focus on the analysis of disinformation of text sources and XAI. <br>
  strong>Partners:</strong> DW, rbb, QUL TU Berlin, DFKI, Fraunhofer IDMT, Ubermetrics Technologies GmbH, delphai GmbH, Crowdee GmbH, neurocat GmbH, Transfermedia GmbH <br>

  <p><strong>BIFOLD Agility Project: FakeXplain</strong><br>
  <strong>Grant Duration:</strong> 2024-11 to 2027-10, <strong>Aquired funding amount:</strong> EUR EUR 269.100</strong> <br>
  The FakeXplain project aims to examine different approaches to generating explanations of AI systems used for human-AI collaboration for the disinformation detection task. Explainability approaches such as attention-based explanations, attribution-based explanations, and computational argumentation will be examined throughout the project, but also recent approaches such as Chain-of-Thought Prompting and Mechanistic Interpretability will be examined concerning their meaningfulness and understandability to human users. Project partners. <br>

  <p><strong>BMBF Project: VERANDA</strong><br>
  <strong>Grant Duration:</strong> 2023-05 to 2026-04, <strong>Grant Number:</strong> 16KIS2047, <strong>Aquired funding amount:</strong> EUR EUR 321.600</strong> <br>
  The VERANDA project is dedicated to applied research into informational self-determination. This includes the analysis, conception, and implementation of information about risks and the sovereign handling of personal data. The project focuses on both the individual and societal level. Specifically, we are looking at the use case of self-determination over personal and highly sensitive medical data in the area of highly stigmatized groups.<br>
  <strong>Partners:</strong> BIH and IfSS Charité, Q&U Lab Technische Universität Berlin, SLT German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, Fraunhofer AISEC<br>

  <h3><strong>Past Projects</strong></h3>
    
  <p><strong>DFG Project: Monetary Evaluation of Location Information</strong><br>
  <strong>Grant Duration:</strong> 2020-02 to 2023-01, <strong>Grant Number:</strong> MO 1038/28-1, <strong>Total funding amount:</strong> EUR 233,220</strong> <br>
  The project goal is to evaluate different methods for the monetary evaluation of privacy. Different user experiments have been conducted, to examine how the monetary valuation relates to various privacy constructs (e.g. privacy concern, awareness, privacy behavior, privacy literacy) and personality traits (e.g. Big 5, passive and active risk-taking, and state of hunger). I was the project leader, but did not acquire the funding for this project! <br>

  <p><strong>DFG Project: Monetary Evaluation of Location Information</strong><br>
  <strong>Grant Duration:</strong> 2023-03 to 2023-12, <strong>Aquired funding amount:</strong> EUR 60,000</strong> <br>
  The ateSDG project is funded by the Climate Change Center Berlin Brandenburg. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) announced by the UN in 2015 are integrated into the Sustainability Reports of companies. To collect and aggregate information about the SDGs, Sustainability Reports from companies are analyzed and classified according to their contribution to one or multiple SDGs. The results are visualized in an SDG monitoring Dashboard for the Berlin Brandenburg region, to provide an overview, of which SDGs are worked on by different industry sectors. <br>
