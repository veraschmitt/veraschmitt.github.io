During the summer term, there are two opportunities to participate in projects:

    * Herby: hardware project, where the task is to build a fully automated hydroponic system for growing vegetables
    * Privacy-related projects: smaller software projects, where the task is to examine various opportunities how to visualize tracking people with their smartphones and study the effect on privacy awareness
* Advanced Study Project:
     * Coding Challenge: scrap additional data in addition to a given dataset related to Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), and apply state-of-the-art NLP models (BERT, BART. GPT-4) model to classify sentences and documents according to the SDGs present in the text
     * Usable Privacy: design user studies to examine the economic perspective of privacy, learn how to analyse data and write scientific reports
