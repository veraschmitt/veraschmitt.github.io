During the Winter term, I am involved in various teaching duties:


Seminar
======
* Usable Privacy Seminar (21/22/23 - M.A. seminar only)
  * students learn how to conduct user studies in the usable privacy domain, analyze the data, and how to summarize the results scientifically. The seminar is a preparation for the master thesis projects, where the students learn in small projects how to conduct scientific studies.
* Statistic Seminar (21/22 - B.A. and M.A. students welcome)  
  * students learn about statistical methods by preparing tutorials about various statistical methods. B.A. students receive simpler methods, such as significance tests and correlation analysis, whereas M.A. students can concentrate on advanced statistical methods. The tutorials are recorded and made accessible to other students who are interested to learn about the methods. Each tutorial contains the video, slides, and a Jupyter notebook with the implementation of the method in Python. 

Projects
======

* Advanced Study Projects:
  * Coding challenges for detecting Sustainable Development Goals in Text
  * User studies in the domains of usable privacy and human-computer interaction
