During the summer term, I am involved in various teaching duties: 

Seminar
======
we are preparing an Ethics of AI seminar for the summer term 2024, which will be also available on KI-Campus

Projects
======
During the summer term, there are two opportunities to participate in projects: 
* Projekt Medienerstellung: projects for B.A. students of Medieninformatik. Here, I usually supervise projects such as:
    * Herby: hardware project, where the task is to build a fully automated hydroponic system for growing vegetables
    * Privacy-related projects: smaller software projects, where the task is to examine various opportunities how to visualize tracking people with their smartphones and study the effect on privacy awareness 

Exercise
======
Usability Engineering Exercise for the lecture Usability Engineering. Students are learning how to conduct small user studies, analyse the data, and generate scientific insights
